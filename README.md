# Timeline App

## The idea:

Ever wish you had a record of when all the big events in your life happened? When you bought your first car, got that awesome job, proposed to your partner?

Perhaps you already have a log of these, perhaps not. How about all the things you did on your overseas roadtrip? What skills you learned when during your various jobs? When you joined Facebook, Twitter, when you started your own blog?

How about a log of all the blog posts you've written? How about the talks you've given? How about the insane grow spurts of your children?

Whatever you choose to log (and let's face it, the more the better), Timeline is the way! Integrate with all your favourite online accounts and watch the magic happen!
